  <strong>Hello!  I'm Dr. Becky Andrews</strong><br> 
(ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she / her)<br> <br> 
As you can see by my tagline to the left, I am a burned out physician, learning to code, seeking a new home in the tech sector. <br> <br> 
I am working toward "full stack" web development certification. <br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and it's adjacent ecosystem (Node, React, etc).  HTML/ CSS certification done. <br><br><br>
As a doctor who has spent 20 years on the frontline delivering complex care, <br>and as an early adopter of EMRs and other tech "solutions" for health care, <br>I can tell you: <br><br> the IT solutions developed for doctors thus far are<br>.... horrible... <br>they make it exponentially more difficult to deliver care.  <br>Doctors and patients have both suffered due to this. <br>
<br><strong>Because of this, I feel an urgent need to be involved in the evolution of the healthcare / IT interface. </strong>
<br>As I learn more about coding, and how coders both think and speak - I deeply believe that the main issue is communication between these 2 highly complex fields. 
I think that administrators essentially tasked the IT community to come up with something ill-defined.  Doctors were rarely asked what they neeeded, AND when they were, because they had no basis for comparison, and because they know nothing about coding, they didn't know what parameters needed to be set (what needs to express). Coders and developers worked really hard and created phenominally complex and elegant solutions that do not actually do what they need to do.  Not because they can't, but because they were not given the necessary parameters.   
<br>
<br> As a physician who's practice years began in the analog / paper era and have ended with the fully digital era (and who also knows how to code), I feel uniquely qualified to help improved the tech solutions devloped for health care (especially EMRs).  
<br><br>
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to get my foot in the door at the healthcare / IT interface. ANY leads are appreciated.<br><br><br>
  <strong>OK, other things: </strong><br>
There are several health related database/ wiki type projects that I feel need to exist that I hope to start buidling soon.<br> 
I really enjoy buidling websites on the Wix platform, and sometimes do that just for fun...<br>
I am really enjoying what goes on "under the hood" of platforms like this and learning how to code pages like that from scratch.

Hello!  I'm Dr. Becky Andrews<br> 
(ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she / her)<br> <br> 
As you can see by my tagline to the left, I am a burned out physician, learning to code, seeking a new home in the tech sector. <br> <br> 
I am working toward "full stack" web development certification. <br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and it's adjacent ecosystem (Node, React, etc).  HTML/ CSS certification done. <br><br><br>
As a doctor who has spent 20 years on the frontline delivering complex care, <br>and as an early adopter of EMRs and other tech "solutions" for health care, <br>I can tell you: <br><br> the IT solutions developed for doctors thus far are<br>.... horrible... <br>they make it exponentially more difficult to deliver care.  <br>Doctors and patients have both suffered due to this. <br>
<br><strong>Because of this, I feel an urgent need to be involved in the evolution of the healthcare / IT interface. </strong>
<br><br> 

As I learn more and more about coding, and how coders both think and speak - I deeply believe that the main issue is communication between these 2 difficult fields. 
I think that administrators essentially tasked the IT community to come up with something ill-defined.  Doctors were rarely asked what they neeeded, AND when they were, because they had no basis for comparison, and because they know nothing about coding, they didn't know what parameters needed to be set (what needs to express). 

I REALLY want to be involved in improving the tools that doctors use to do their jobs (Electronic Medical Records).  

There are also several database/ wiki type projects that I feel need to exist that I hope to start buidling soon. 

On a completely different note, I really enjoy buidling websites on the Wix platform, and sometimes do that just for fun...
I am really enjoying what goes on "under the hood" of platforms like this and learning how to code pages like that from scratch.  

<br>

<br>
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m lookig for opportunities to get my foot in the door at the tech / IT interface. ANY leads are appreciated.
